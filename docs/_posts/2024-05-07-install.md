First, you should find the environment.yml, which cover most of software and dependencies installed by conda.
Moreover, you can replace ```mamba``` to ```conda``` to speed up.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After installing from conda, you can run 
``` 
conda activate FdR
```
to active relative environment.

By the way, you can specify the name of environment by editing the first line of environment.yml

There're still three software need to install in binary file.
