To run pipeline successfully, two files are necessary.

One is .py file which includes analysis steps, while config file which allocate necessary files. Both of them can be found in /script/

There're two types of config files which called `configForMainTail.yaml` and `configForModifAS.yaml`.

First is used for dRNAmain and dRNAtail, while other is for dRNAmodif_1/_2 and dRNAas.py.

You needn't to worry since the location of yaml has been assigned in .py files.

We also offer examples of config files in /examples/
